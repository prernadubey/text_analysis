whistleblowing Products and services Careers Diversity inclusion Accelerating gender diversity Accelerating gender diversity at Volvo Group We recognize that the transport and infrastructure industry and our business has traditionally had a gender imbalance and still does For over a decade Volvo Group has worked systematically to increase inclusion and improve the gender balance of the organization We have set ourselves a target of 35 women amongst all employees and leaders by 2030 and a broad variety of initiatives are being designed to work towards that target On a daily basis the Group is striving to move the needle towards increased gender equality not only because it is fair and the right thing to do but because it is essential for our business performance Equality is not a women s concern it s a business concern Being included feels good let s all fully EmbraceEquity To reach our target of 35 female employees at Volvo Group by 2030 both in leadership positions and in general we all have an important role to play Volvo Group is committed to challenging the status quo on gender equality Equity isn t just a nice to have it s a need to have A focus on gender equity needs to be part of every society s DNA We can all truly embrace equity It s not just something we say It s not just something we write about It s something we need to think about know and embrace Equity means creating an inclusive world At Volvo Energy overall we currently have 36 women and in the Volvo Energy Executive Leadership Team I am proud to say we have 55 female leaders But we are of course not stopping there In order to truly walk the talk we continuously work to embrace equity from every aspect For example we endorse mutual respect and have zero tolerance for any form of harassment or discrimination and it must start from the top says Joachim Rosenberg EVP Strategic Initiatives President Volvo Energy On this day I also reflect over young females who are now taking the first decisions towards their future careers when choosing enrollment to high school or university We need to convince them that our industry is for them That the Volvo Group is a place where you can thrive no matter gender That s why initiatives like tecHER are so valuable but we need to do more In our everyday lives we actively need to support and encourage equity for everyone giving everyone the opportunity to reach for the stars Joachim ends Each one of us can actively support and embrace equity within our own sphere of influence We can all challenge gender stereotypes call out discrimination draw attention to bias and seek out inclusion Collective activism is what drives change From grassroots action to wide scale momentum we can all embrace equity Kate Thompson Head of Diversity Engagement Inclusion at Volvo Group puts it like this Most inequality exists as a result of systems that weren t built to be inclusive For us to break the barriers and bias that exist we must understand the needs of individuals today Equity is enabling greater inclusion and participation by truly understanding the needs of our people and building our systems to incorporate these We must constantly ask ourselves who was this system was built for and is it still fit for purpose We must constantly challenge ourselves to move beyond basic identity characteristics to the uniqueness of each individual This will unleash the full potential of the Volvo Group Committed for more women in leadership roles In 2022 the Volvo Group took part in the Women in Leadership Positions report published by the European Round Table for Industry ERT for the second time The aim of this document is to demonstrate a growing corporate culture at a wide range of European multinationals which leads to promote inclusion and gender equality by enhancing the career advancement of women to leadership positions Signing up to this report means choosing to make our targets public and to report on our progress year by year Measuring and following up on progress drives actionability and stimulates us to drive change in order to come to the next level It helps us get from vision to action We are
